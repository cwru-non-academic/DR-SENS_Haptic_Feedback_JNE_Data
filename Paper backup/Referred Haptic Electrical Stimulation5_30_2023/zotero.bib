	abstract = {The effect of subcutaneous fat thickness, electrode size and inter-electrode distance on the minimum stimulus current necessary for ﬁber excitation was examined in an attempt to improve the efﬁcacy of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) in obese populations. A three-dimensional ﬁnite element model of the human thigh was developed and used to calculate the potential along a myelinated nerve ﬁber due to NMES. The activating function was used to examine alterations in the excitation of the ﬁber due to fat thickness, electrode size and inter-electrode distance. The ﬁnite element model was coupled to a neural model to examine the stimulus current required for action potential propagation. The stimulus current required to evoke 10\% of the maximum M-wave amplitude was measured experimentally. Both experimental and modeling studies indicated that the stimulus current required to reach the threshold for muscle activation increased with fat thickness, electrode size, and inter-electrode distance. However, as fat thickness increased, the threshold for muscle activation became less sensitive to inter-electrode distance and electrode size. These results suggest that by using larger electrodes above regions of high subcutaneous fat thickness, the efﬁcacy of NMES could be maintained while reducing the current density at the skin and the associated subject discomfort.},

	abstract = {Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS), which has shown promise in the visual, auditory and somatosensory systems as a platform for sensory prostheses, typically relies on charged balanced, symmetric, biphasic stimulation. However, neural stimulation models as well as experiments conducted in cochlear implant users have suggested that charge balanced asymmetric pulses could generate lower detection thresholds for stimulation in terms of charge per phase. For this study, rats were chronically implanted with microelectrode arrays unilaterally in their right auditory cortex and then trained to detect ICMS delivered through a single electrode site in order to determine their behavioral threshold. This model was used in two experiments. The first experiment addressed the effect of lead phase direction, asymmetry, and phase duration on detection threshold. The second experiment fixed the cathode phase duration at 123 μs and varied only the phase asymmetry and lead phase direction. Taken together, the results of these experiments suggest that, for ICMS, the primary determinant of threshold level is cathode phase duration, and that asymmetry provides no significant advantage when compared to symmetric, cathode leading pulses. However, symmetric anode leading pulses of less than or equal to 205 μs per phase consistently showed higher thresholds when compared to all other pulses of equal cathode phase duration.},

However, it can be challenging to meet this requirement using conventional robotic design approaches that rely on rigid mechanical systems with limited workspace and bandwidth. An alternative solution can be seen in the adoption of lightweight wearable systems equipped with Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES): in fact, NMES offers a wide range of different forces and qualities of haptic feedback. In this study, we present an experimental setup able to enrich the virtual reality experience by employing NMES to create in the antagonists’ muscles the haptic sensation of being loaded. We developed a subject-specific biomechanical model that estimated elbow torque during object lifting to deliver suitable electrical muscle stimulations. We experimentally tested our system by exploring the differences between the implemented NMES-based haptic feedback (NMES condition), a physical lifted object (Physical condition), and a condition without haptic feedback (Visual condition) in terms of kinematic response, metabolic effort, and participants’ perception of fatigue. Our results showed that both in terms of metabolic consumption and user fatigue perception, the condition with electrical stimulation and the condition with the real weight differed significantly from the condition without any load: the implemented feedback was able to faithfully reproduce interactions with objects, suggesting its possible application in different areas such as gaming, work risk assessment simulation, and education.},

Compared with a mechanical tactile display that is typically composed of vibrating pins, the electro-tactile display has several merits, such as thinness and mechanical robustness. However, there remain several issues to be solved, such as stabilization. Furthermore, the development of the electro-tactile display requires certain knowledge of electrical circuits. The present paper thus serves as an introduction to research on electro-tactile displays. We start by explaining the principle of electrical nerve stimulation, introducing how the spatial distribution of the electrical current source affects stimulation using the notion of the activating function, and discuss temporal parameters (i.e., pulse width and pulse height) using a simplified nerve model and introducing the strength-duration curve. A typical hardware design, including a voltage-to-current converter circuit and a switching circuit is then introduced, and the electrode fabrication process and necessity of a conductive gel layer are discussed. Finally, the issue of sensation stabilization is treated with possible solutions.},

The psychometric tests confirmed that the subjects could perceive and interpret the electrotactile feedback with a high success rate. The subjects performed the routine grasping task comprising 4 blocks of 60 grasping trials. In each trial, the subjects employed feedforward control to close the hand and produce the desired grasping force (four levels). First (baseline) and the last (validation) session were performed in open loop, while the second and the third session (training) included electrotactile feedback. The obtained results confirmed that using the feedback improved the accuracy and precision of the force control.

	abstract = {The restoration of sensory feedback in amputees plays a fundamental role in the prosthesis control and in the communication on the afferent channel between hand and brain. The literature shows that transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) can be a promising non-invasive technique to elicit sensory feedback in amputees, especially in the lower limb through the phenomenon of apparent moving sensation (AMS). It consists of delivering a sensation that moves along a specific part of the body. This study proposes to use TENS to elicit tactile sensations and adopt AMS to reproduce moving sensations on the hand, such as those related to an object moving in the hand or slipping upward or downward. To this purpose, the developed experimental protocol consists of two phases: (i) the mapping of the evoked sensations and (ii) the generation of the AMS. In the latter phase, the pulse amplitude variation (PAV), the pulse width variation (PWV), and the interstimulus delay modulation (ISDM) methods were compared. For the comparative analysis, the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test with Bonferroni correction (P {\textless} 0.016) was carried out on the success rate and on the ranking of methods expressed by the subjects. Results from the mapping protocol show that the delivered sensations were mostly described by the subjects as almost natural and superficial tingling. Results from the AMS protocol show that, for each movement direction, the success rate of ISDM method is higher than that of PWV and PAV and significantly higher than that of PAV for the ulnar-median direction. It recreates an AMS in the hand that effectively allows discriminating the type of sensation and distinguishing the movement direction. Moreover, ISDM was ranked by the subjects as the favorite method for recreating a well-defined and comfortable moving sensation only in the median-ulnar direction. For the ranking results, there was not a statistically significant difference among the methods. The experiments confirmed the good potential of recreating an AMS in the hand through TENS. This encourages to push forward this study on amputees and integrate it in the closed-loop control of a prosthetic system, in order to enable full control of grasp stability and prevent the objects from slippage.},

The electrotactile interface needs to be calibrated before each use, which entails adjusting the intensity to obtain clear sensations while allowing the subjects to differentiate between active pads. The present study investigated how the stimulation intensity affects the localization of sensations using a multi-pad electrode placed on a ﬁngertip and proximal phalange. First, the sensation, localization, smearing and discomfort thresholds were determined in 11 subjects. Then, the same subjects performed a spatial discrimination test across a range of stimulation intensities. The results have shown that all thresholds were signiﬁcantly different, while there was no difference in the threshold values between the pads and phalanges. Despite the subjective feeling of spreading of sensations, the success rates in spatial discrimination were not signiﬁcantly different across the tested stimulation intensities. However, the performance was better for distal compared to proximal phalange. Presented results indicate that spatial discrimination is robust to changes in the stimulation intensity. Considering the lack of signiﬁcant difference in the thresholds between the pads, these results imply that more coarse adjustment of stimulation amplitude (faster calibration) might be enough for practical applications of a multi-pad electrotactile interface.},

Restoring sensory function from prosthetic hand to amputee remains a great challenge to neural engineering. In this paper, we present the development of a sensory feedback system based on the phenomenon of evoked tactile sensation (ETS) at the stump skin of residual limb induced by transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). The system could map a dynamic pattern of stimuli to an electrode placed on the corresponding projected finger areas on the stump skin. A pressure transducer placed at the tip of prosthetic fingers was used to sense contact pressure, and a high performance DSP processor sampled pressure signals, and calculated the amplitude of feedback stimulation in real-time. Biphasic and charge-balanced current pulses with amplitude modulation generated by a multi-channel laboratory stimulator were delivered to activate sensory nerves beneath the skin. We tested this sensory feedback system in amputee subjects. Preliminary results showed that the subjects could perceive different levels of pressure at the tip of prosthetic finger through evoked tactile sensation (ETS) with distinct grades and modalities. We demonstrated the feasibility to restore the perceptual sensation from prosthetic fingers to amputee based on the phenomenon of evoked tactile sensation (ETS) with TENS.},

	abstract = {This paper reports a pilot study to explore the plausibility of using the phenomenon of phantom finger perception (PFP) in amputees to develop sensory feedback for prosthetic hand. PFP can be aroused by touching a specific part of the skin in the stump area of amputees. We hypothesized that transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TES) can evoke the similar PFP in amputees with electrodes placed at the same skin area. We tested this hypothesis in subjects with distal amputation at the forearm above the wrist. The areas of PFP on the stump skin of amputee subjects were first identified and labeled by manually touching the skin. Electrical stimulation was then applied to the same area with surface electrode. The subjects reported that the corresponding finger was touched with electrical stimulation, and gradation of sensation with increased strength of stimulation current was perceived in a similar way as reported in normal subjects. Peripheral nerve sprouting into the receptors in stump skin after amputation is speculated as the neural mechanism of PFP. Preliminary results support the hypothesis that PFP evoked by TES can be utilized to establish a direct sensory feedback from the fingers of prosthetic hand to the amputee.},

	abstract = {Tactile feedback is relevant in a broad range of human-machine interaction systems (e.g. teleoperation, virtual reality and prosthetics). The available tactile feedback interfaces comprise few sensing and stimulation units, which limits the amount of information conveyed to the user. The present study describes a novel technology that relies on distributed sensing and stimulation to convey comprehensive tactile feedback to the user of a robotic end effector. The system comprises six flexible sensing arrays (57 sensors) integrated on the fingers and palm of a robotic hand, embedded electronics (64 recording channels), a multichannel stimulator and seven flexible electrodes (64 stimulation pads) placed on the volar side of the subject's hand. The system was tested in seven subjects asked to recognize contact positions and identify contact sliding on the electronic skin, using distributed anode configuration (DAC) and single dedicated anode configuration. The experiments demonstrated that DAC resulted in substantially better performance. Using DAC, the system successfully translated the contact patterns into electrotactile profiles that the subjects could recognize with satisfactory accuracy ([Formula: see text] for static and [Formula: see text] for dynamic patterns). The proposed system is an important step towards the development of a high-density human-machine interfacing between the user and a robotic hand.

We implement this by applying electro-tactile stimulation only to the back of the hand and to the wrist. In our approach, there are no electrodes on the palmar side, yet that is where tactile sensations are felt. While we place electrodes outside the user’s palm, we do so in strategic locations that conduct the electrical currents to the median/ulnar nerves, causing tactile sensations on the palmar side of the hand. In our user studies, we demonstrated that our approach renders tactile sensations to 11 diferent locations on the palmar side while keeping users’ palms free for dexterous manipulations.},

	abstract = {Electrical stimulation of the peripheral nerves of human participants provides a unique opportunity to study the neural determinants of perceptual quality using a causal manipulation. A major challenge in the study of neural coding of touch has been to isolate the role of spike timing—at the scale of milliseconds or tens of milliseconds—in shaping the sensory experience. In the present study, we address this question by systematically varying the pulse frequency (PF) of electrical stimulation pulse trains delivered to the peripheral nerves of seven participants with upper and lower extremity limb loss via chronically implanted neural interfaces. We find that increases in PF lead to systematic increases in perceived frequency, up to ∼50 Hz, at which point further changes in PF have little to no impact on sensory quality. Above this transition frequency, ratings of perceived frequency level off, the ability to discriminate changes in PF is abolished, and verbal descriptors selected to characterize the sensation change abruptly. We conclude that sensation quality is shaped by temporal patterns of neural activation, even if these patterns are imposed on a fixed neural population, but this temporal patterning can only be resolved up to ∼50 Hz. These findings highlight the importance of spike timing in shaping the quality of a sensation and will contribute to the development of encoding strategies for conveying touch feedback through bionic hands and feet.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT A major challenge in the study of neural coding of touch has been to understand how temporal patterns in neuronal responses shape the sensory experience. We address this question by varying the pulse frequency (PF) of electrical pulse trains delivered through implanted nerve interfaces in seven amputees. We concomitantly vary pulse width to separate the effect of changing PF on sensory quality from its effect on perceived magnitude. We find that increases in PF lead to increases in perceived frequency, a qualitative dimension, up to ∼50 Hz, beyond which changes in PF have little impact on quality. We conclude that temporal patterning in the neuronal response can shape quality and discuss the implications for restoring touch via neural interfaces.},

This paper surveys the paradigm shift of haptic display occurred in the past 30 years, which is classified into three stages, including desktop haptics, surface haptics, and wearable haptics. The driving forces, key technologies and typical applications in each stage are critically reviewed. Toward the future high-fidelity VR interaction, research challenges are highlighted concerning handheld haptic device, multimodal haptic device, and high fidelity haptic rendering. In the end, the importance of understanding human haptic perception for designing effective haptic devices is addressed.},

	doi = {10.1109/InfoSEEE.2014.6948137},
	abstract = {Epiretinal electrical stimulation provides a promising approach to restore functional vision for patients suffering from retinal degenerative diseases. The electrodes of epiretinal prosthesis stimulate the surviving ganglion cells and cause visual percepts. To further improve the performance of epiretinal electrodes, an optimized solution in electrode design has to be found based on modeling analysis. In this study, different three-dimensional (3-D) electrode models were built to investigate the effects of electrode size and electrode shape on epiretinal electrical stimulation. The retina was presented by a multi-layered computational model using finite element method. Results indicate that small-sized electrodes required lower threshold current but higher threshold charge density. Non-planar electrodes had higher threshold currents than disk electrode. Concave electrodes needed less threshold charge densities than disk and convex ones. Under the stimulation of the same-multiple threshold current, the activation areas of disk and concave electrodes were more convergent than that of convex electrodes. To conclude, small-sized electrode is recommended if the charge density could be within the safe limit. In consideration of superior electrode safety and stimulation selectivity, concave electrodes are more preferable choices among the electrodes with different geometric shapes. The modeling simulation result of disk electrodes showed a desirable concordance with the animal electrophysiological experiments. This modeling analysis of different 3-D electrodes on epiretinal electrical stimulation may provide meaningful guidance for the optimization of future electrode design.},

Some simulation studies have investigated the percentage of fibers activated in denervated skeletal muscles, the comfort and selectivity, and the influence of fat thickness in the case of obese people, to optimize the inter-electrode distance and electrode size. However, the effect of the inter-electrode distance, electrode shape and electrode size might be further analyzed using the selectivity, activation depth and activation volume. In this regard, we developed a 3D multi-layer (skin, fat, muscle, and nerve) thigh model coupled with a mammalian nerve model using a finite element method for optimization of TES therapy. Different evaluation indices (motor threshold, activation depth, selectivity and activation volume) were inspected to compare different TES parameters in terms of nerve activation. The simulation results agreed with experimental data and new insights were obtained: selectivity is better in small electrodes; nevertheless, in high current stimulation, small electrodes and large electrodes have similar selectivity.},

	abstract = {A range of dynamic and static vergence responses were evaluated in 12 individuals with mild traumatic brain injury (age: 29 +/- 3 yr) having near vision symptoms. All measures were performed in a crossover design before and after oculomotor training (OMT) and placebo (P) training. Following OMT, peak velocity for both convergence and divergence increased significantly. Increased peak velocity was significantly correlated with increased clinically based vergence prism flipper rate. Steady-state response variability for convergence reduced significantly following OMT. The maximum amplitude of convergence, relative fusional amplitudes, and near stereoacuity improved significantly. In addition, symptoms reduced significantly, and visual attention improved markedly. None of the measures were found to change significantly following P training. The significant improvement in most aspects of vergence eye movements following OMT demonstrates considerable residual brain plasticity via oculomotor learning. The improved vergence affected positively on nearwork-related symptoms and visual attention. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

The haptic interface was designed so that the haptic feedback could be turned on or switched off. Students (N = 64), in two secondary schools, worked in pairs, on activities designed to support learning of specific difficult concepts. Findings from observation of the activities and interviews revealed that students believed that being immersed in the 3D VR environment and being able to feel structures and movements within the model and work collaboratively assisted their learning. More specifically, the pilot/co-pilot model that we developed was successful for enabling collaborative learning and reducing the isolating effects of immersion with a 3D headset. Results of pre and post-tests of conceptual knowledge showed significant knowledge gains but addition of haptic feedback did not affect the knowledge gains significantly.

	abstract = {Electro- or vibro-tactile stimulations were used in the past to provide sensory information in many different applications ranging from human manual control to prosthetics. The two modalities were used separately in the past, and we hypothesized that a hybrid vibro-electrotactile (HyVE) stimulation could provide two afferent streams that are independently perceived by a subject, although delivered in parallel and through the same skin location. We conducted psychophysical experiments where healthy subjects were asked to recognize the intensities of electro- and vibro-tactile stimuli during hybrid and single modality stimulations. The results demonstrated that the subjects were able to discriminate the features of the two modalities within the hybrid stimulus, and that the cross-modality interaction was limited enough to allow better transmission of discrete information (messages) using hybrid versus single modality coding. The percentages of successful recognitions (mean ± standard deviation) for nine messages were 56 ±11\% and 72 ±8\% for two hybrid coding schemes, compared to 29 ±7\% for vibrotactile and 44 ±4\% for electrotactile coding. The HyVE can be therefore an attractive solution in numerous application for providing sensory feedback in prostheses and rehabilitation, and it could be used to increase the resolution of a single variable or to simultaneously feedback two different variables.},

The modality, quality, location, and magnitude of the sensations were evaluated when the stimulations were applied on the forearm skin in 16 nondisabled subjects. Tactile perception was found to be induced more easily on the median and ulnar aspect than the dorsal and radial aspect of the forearm. Stimulation site significantly affected the magnitude of the sensation (p {\textless} 0.01). Dual-channel stimulation significantly increased the sensation magnitude (p {\textless} 0.05) only when the two electrodes were positioned closely. Moreover, a higher number of pulses evoked a movement perception more frequently and the interleaved time showed no significant effect on the magnitude of the sensation. The findings are expected to be useful for sensory substitution and augmentation applications. The results may also help improve users' acceptance of hand prostheses.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have shown that direct nerve stimulation can be used to provide sensory feedback to hand amputees. The intensity of the elicited sensations can be modulated using the amplitude or frequency of the injected stimuli. However, a comprehensive comparison of the effects of these two encoding strategies on the amputees’ ability to control a prosthesis has not been performed. In this paper, we assessed the performance of two trans-radial amputees controlling a myoelectric hand prosthesis while receiving grip force sensory feedback encoded using either linear modulation of amplitude (LAM) or linear modulation of frequency (LFM) of direct nerve stimulation (namely, bidirectional prostheses). Both subjects achieved similar and significantly above-chance performance when they were asked to exploit LAM or LFM in different tasks. The feedbacks allowed them to discriminate, during manipulation through the robotic hand, objects of different compliances and shapes or different placements on the prosthesis. Similar high performances were obtained when they were asked to apply different levels of force in a random order on a dynamometer using LAM or LFM. In contrast, only the LAM strategy allowed the subjects to continuously modulate the grip pressure on the dynamometer. Furthermore, when long-lasting trains of stimulation were delivered, LFM strategy generated a very fast adaptation phenomenon in the subjects, which caused them to stop perceiving the restored sensations. Both encoding approaches were perceived as very different from the touch feelings of the healthy limb (natural). These results suggest that the choice of specific sensory feedback encodings can have an effect on user performance while grasping. In addition, our results invite the development of new approaches to provide more natural sensory feelings to the users, which could be addressed by a more biomimetic strategy in the future.},

Being able to stimulate as many types of mechanoreceptors as possible, the use of electrical stimulation is widespread. However, the area of a device is usually limited because the more electrodes a device is composed of, the more difficult wires are placed if we want to deliver different signals to different regions of one touch panel simultaneously. To get closer to the possibility of integrating multi-touch tactile devices operated by electrotactile stimulation into smartphones or other flat-panel displays, this paper focuses on developing a large-area electrotactile display device driven by electrotactile stimulation that can fully cover smartphones, which has the advantages of larger touched area and better resolution comparing to traditional ones. It is also capable of delivering different stimulation simultaneously on the same surface. The new type of touch panel with cathodes-surrounding anodes taking responsibility for delivering signals and cathodes playing the role of switches to divide signals.},

	abstract = {This paper describes an electrotactile display with micro-needle electrodes. The electrotactile display can produce tactile sensations by stimulating tactile receptors using an electric current. Micro-needle electrodes can drastically decrease the threshold voltage required to stimulate tactile receptors by penetrating the stratum corneum, which has a higher impedance than the dermis. In addition, the optimized length of the needle allows us to stimulate tactile receptors painlessly. In the present study, we developed a process for fabricating a micro-needle array in which the length and tip radius can be controlled using electrochemical etching. A micro-needle array was successfully fabricated to form an electrotactile display. In addition, we experimentally determined the suitable shape of the microneedle electrodes for electrotactile display applications. When the tip radius of the needle is too small, the impedance between the finger and micro-needles becomes large due to the small contact area. On the other hand, when the tip radius is too large, the needle cannot penetrate the skin surface and the impedance is not sufficiently small. The experiments verified the superiority of needle electrode devices to flat electrode devices with respect to the threshold voltage at each frequency.},

In particular, a force-sensitive robotic gripper is connected to a hand exoskeleton, mimics the user's hand movements, and transfers haptic feedback through the exoskeleton. The two-finger exoskeleton's design process consists of a multi-criteria optimization procedure to simultaneously maximize applied force to the finger and workspace of the attached exoskeleton, optimizing both the Perpendicular Impact Force (PIF) and the Global Isotropy Index (GII), considering worst-case collision avoidance. Due to the tele-operation application and using a robotic arm as a slave in the remote scenario, the gripper can be used as an end-effector for a palletizing 3-DOF robotic arm, and movement of the gripper can be achieved by using a visual sensor to pinpoint the user's hand location in 3D space. With the aim of the stress analysis software, the exoskeleton and gripper designs were analyzed to evaluate the system strength against applied forces. Finally, based on the achieved results, the gripper and two-fingered exoskeleton prototypes were fabricated. Simulations and experimental results are reported, showing the potential of the HEXON in haptics and tele-operation applications, and the exoskeleton is used to operate a robotic arm and gripper while the user can perceive the objects virtually.},

Although restoration of touch by means of implantable neural interfaces has been achieved, these approaches require surgical interventions, and their long-term usability still needs to be fully investigated. Here, we developed a non-invasive alternative which maintains some of the advantages of invasive approaches, such as a somatotopic sensory restitution scheme. We used transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) to induce referred sensations to the phantom hand of amputees. These sensations were characterized in four amputees over two weeks. Although the induced sensation was often paresthesia, the location corresponded to parts of the innervation regions of the median and ulnar nerves, and electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings confirmed the presence of appropriate responses in relevant cortical areas. Using these sensations as feedback during bidirectional prosthesis control, the patients were able to perform several functional tasks that would not be possible otherwise, such as applying one of three levels of force on an external sensor. Performance during these tasks was high, suggesting that this approach could be a viable alternative to the more invasive solutions, offering a trade-off between the quality of the sensation, and the invasiveness of the intervention.},

	abstract = {There is multiple evidence in the literature that a sub-threshold pre-pulse, delivered immediately prior to an electrical stimulation pulse, can alter the activation threshold of nerve fibers and motor unit recruitment characteristics. So far, previously published works combined monophasic stimuli with sub-threshold depolarizing pre-pulses (DPPs) with inconsistent findings—in some studies, the DPPs decreased the activation threshold, while in others it was increased. This work aimed to evaluate the effect of DPPs during biphasic transcutaneous electrical stimulation and to study the possible mechanism underlying those differences. Sub-threshold DPPs between 0.5 and 15 ms immediately followed by biphasic or monophasic pulses were administered to the tibial nerve; the electrophysiological muscular responses (motor-wave, M-wave) were monitored via electromyogram (EMG) recording from the soleus muscle. The data show that, under the specific studied conditions, DPPs tend to lower the threshold for nerve fiber activation rather than elevating it. DPPs with the same polarity as the leading phase of biphasic stimuli are more effective to increase the sensitivity. This work assesses for the first time the effect of DPPs on biphasic pulses, which are required to achieve charge-balanced stimulation, and it provides guidance on the effect of polarity and intensity to take full advantage of this feature., 
Graphical abstractIn this work, the effect of sub-threshold depolarizing pre-pulses (DPP) is investigated in a setup with transcutaneous electrical stimulation. We found that, within the tested 0–15 ms DPP duration range, the DPPs administered immediately before biphasic pulses proportionally increase the nerve excitability as visible in the M-waves recorded from the soleus muscle. Interestingly, these findings oppose published results, where DPPs, administered immediately before monophasic stimuli via implanted electrodes, led to decrease of nerve excitability.},

Nerve cuff electrode arrays were implanted for stimulation of the sciatic nerves of rats and the sensory compound action potentials were recorded from the L4 dorsal root. A model of the nerve cuff electrode array and sciatic nerve was also developed. The experimental and modelling results were compared. Experiments showed that it took 8 ms for the sensory fibers to completely recover from a conditioning stimulus, regardless of the relative position of the electrodes used for stimulation. The results demonstrate that the electrodes on the cuff cannot be considered independent. Additionally, at 120\% of the threshold, there is a large overlap in the fibers that were activated by the different electrodes. If a stimulus paradigm considered the electrodes as independent, stimuli from the different electrodes would need to be interleaved, and the intervals between the stimuli should be greater than 8 ms.},

	abstract = {Objective: Haptic perception is critical for prosthetic users to control their prosthetic hand intuitively. In this study, we seek to evaluate the haptic perception evoked from concurrent stimulation trains through multiple channels using transcutaneous nerve stimulation. Methods: A 2 × 8 electrode grid was used to deliver current to the median and ulnar nerves in the upper arm. Different electrodes were first selected to activate the sensory axons, which can elicit sensations at different locations of the hand. Charge-balanced bipolar stimulation was then delivered to two sets of electrodes concurrently with a phase delay (dual stimulation) to determine whether the evoked sensation can be constructed from sensations of single stimulation delivered separately at different locations (single stimulation) along the electrode grid. The temporal delay between the two stimulation trains was altered to evaluate potential interference. The short-term stability of the haptic sensation within a testing session was also evaluated. Results: The evoked sensation during dual stimulation was largely a direct summation of the sensation from single stimulations. The delay between the two stimulation locations had minimal effect on the evoked sensations, which was also stable over repeated testing within a session. Conclusion: Our results indicated that the haptic sensations at different regions of the hand can be constructed by combining the response from multiple stimulation trains directly. The interference between stimulations were minimal.

	abstract = {Background
Consistency is one of the most important concerns to convey stable artificially induced sensory feedback. However, the constancy of perceived sensations cannot be guaranteed, as the artificially evoked sensation is a function of the interaction of stimulation parameters. The hypothesis of this study is that the selected stimulation parameters in multi-electrode cutaneous stimulation have significant impacts on the perception threshold.

Methods
The investigated parameters included the stimulated location, the number of active electrodes, the number of pulses, and the interleaved time between a pair of electrodes. Biphasic, rectangular pulses were applied via five surface electrodes placed on the forearm of 12 healthy subjects.

Results
Our main findings were: 1) the perception thresholds at the five stimulated locations were significantly different (p {\textless} 0.0001), 2) dual-channel simultaneous stimulation lowered the perception thresholds and led to smaller variance in perception thresholds compared to single-channel stimulation, 3) the perception threshold was inversely related to the number of pulses, and 4) the perception threshold increased with increasing interleaved time when the interleaved time between two electrodes was below 500 μs.

Conclusions
To maintain a consistent perception threshold, our findings indicate that dual-channel simultaneous stimulation with at least five pulses should be used, and that the interleaved time between two electrodes should be longer than 500 μs. We believe that these findings have implications for design of reliable sensory feedback codes.},

	abstract = {Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is a widely used technique for clinical diagnostic, treatment, and research. Normally, it applies charge-balanced biphasic pulses, which several publications have reported to be less efficient than monophasic pulses. A good alternative is the use of interphase intervals (IPI) on biphasic pulses that allows to achieve similar responses than those evoked by monophasic stimulation. This study analyzes the enhancing mechanism of the IPI and provides guidelines on how to optimize the IPI in order to reduce secondary effects such as the electrode corrosion. The tibial nerve was excited by NMES biphasic pulses with different IPI durations and polarities. Then, the elicited responses were recorded on the soleus muscle via electromyography. When cathodic-first pulses were applied, the responses increased proportionally to the IPI until the duration of 250 µs, where the increase saturated at 30\% of the original amplitude. The responses evoked during anodic-first were 6\% to 30\% smaller than those evoked during cathodic-first pulses and continuously increased until the IPI duration of 2500 µs, where the responses reached an increase of around 30\%. The results suggest that when a cathodic-first pulse is used, the IPI could be optimized (based on the setup geometry) to allow the action potentials to travel out of the hyperpolarization zone induced by the anodic phase. When anodic-first stimuli are applied, the IPI duration allows the fiber to recover from an apparent insensitive state induced by the anodic phase. The use of IPI is a viable option to improve the efficiency of actual stimulation systems, since only small modifications are required to significantly reduce the electrical charge required and boost the stimulation efficiency.},

	abstract = {Perceived intensity: A touchy subject for neuroprostheses
Without tactile sensory input, amputees discern a firm handshake from a bone-crushing grip by visual cues and learned behavior. Next-generation prostheses aim to lend a more natural feel to artificial touch by transmitting nuanced sensory feedback. Graczyk et al. looked at direct stimulation of the radial, ulnar, and median nerves via implanted electrodes in two amputees to understand how levels of intensity are perceived and how tactile sensory feedback is transmitted. By modulating the number of nerve fibers stimulated and the frequency of stimulation, sensory information could be transmitted such that the amputees could distinguish distinct levels of tactile intensity, that is, the difference between a 7 and a 10 on a scale of intensity.
Electrical stimulation of sensory nerves is a powerful tool for studying neural coding because it can activate neural populations in ways that natural stimulation cannot. Electrical stimulation of the nerve has also been used to restore sensation to patients who have suffered the loss of a limb. We have used long-term implanted electrical interfaces to elucidate the neural basis of perceived intensity in the sense of touch. To this end, we assessed the sensory correlates of neural firing rate and neuronal population recruitment independently by varying two parameters of nerve stimulation: pulse frequency and pulse width. Specifically, two amputees, chronically implanted with peripheral nerve electrodes, performed each of three psychophysical tasks—intensity discrimination, magnitude scaling, and intensity matching—in response to electrical stimulation of their somatosensory nerves. We found that stimulation pulse width and pulse frequency had systematic, cooperative effects on perceived tactile intensity and that the artificial tactile sensations could be reliably matched to skin indentations on the intact limb. We identified a quantity we termed the activation charge rate (ACR), derived from stimulation parameters, that predicted the magnitude of artificial tactile percepts across all testing conditions. On the basis of principles of nerve fiber recruitment, the ACR represents the total population spike count in the activated neural population. Our findings support the hypothesis that population spike count drives the magnitude of tactile percepts and indicate that sensory magnitude can be manipulated systematically by varying a single stimulation quantity.
Electrical connections between nerves and a prosthetic device enable amputees to discern precise, graded sensory intensity ranging from light touch to intense pressure.

In order to increase the immersive feeling of interaction with the virtual world, haptic devices allow us to touch and manipulate virtual objects in an intuitive way. In this paper, we introduce a portable and low-cost haptic glove that provides both force and tactile feedback using a direct-control pneumatic concept. To produce force feedback, two inlet ports of a double acting pneumatic cylinder are opened and closed via solenoid DC valves through Pulse-width modulation (PWM) technique. For tactile feedback, an air bladder is actuated using a diaphragm pump via PWM operated solenoid valve. Experiments on a single finger prototype validated that the glove can provide force and tactile feedback with sufficient moving range of the finger joints. The maximum continuous force is 9 Newton and the response time is less than 400ms. The glove is light weighted and easy to be mounted on the index finger. The proposed glove could be potentially used for virtual reality grasping scenarios and for teleoperation of a robotic hand for handling hazardous objects.},

The main research objective was to investigate if and how task performance and perceived intuitiveness is affected when interactive soniﬁcation and/or haptic feedback is used to provide real-time feedback about a movement performed in a 3D virtual environment. Emphasis was put on task solving efﬁciency and subjective accounts of participants’ experiences of the multimodal interaction in different conditions. The experiment used a within-subjects design in which the participants solved the same task in different conditions: visual-only, visuohaptic, audiovisual and audiovisuohaptic. Two different sound models were implemented and compared. Signiﬁcantly lower error rates were obtained in the audiovisuohaptic condition involving movement soniﬁcation based on a physical model of friction, compared to the visual-only condition. Moreover, a signiﬁcant increase in perceived intuitiveness was observed for most conditions involving haptic and/or auditory feedback, compared to the visual-only condition. The main ﬁnding of this study is that multimodal feedback can not only improve perceived intuitiveness of an interface but that certain combinations of haptic feedback and movement soniﬁcation can also contribute with performance-enhancing properties. This highlights the importance of carefully designing feedback combinations for interactive applications.},

The technique is based on the formulation of band-limited multiple Fourier Linear Combiners (BMFLC) and is called Enhanced-BMFLC (E-BMFLC). The effectiveness of the designed filter is statistically evaluated through a clinical study involving 14 PD and 13 ET patients. The hand tremors of the participants are studied in three Degrees Of Freedom (DOF). Using statistical analysis, it is shown that the new design of the filter significantly enhances the accuracy in comparison with the performance of conventional BMFLC filtering. In addition, E-BMFLC significantly reduces the sensitivity to parameter tuning and intrapatient variabilities. The observed improvements are achieved by modulating the memory of the proposed filter, and by enriching the utilized harmonic model. The proposed filter is then used to develop a safe haptics-enabled robotic rehabilitation architecture, designed for patients having hand tremors. The architecture is entitled Augmented Haptic Rehabilitation (AHR), which enables adaptive management of the involuntary components of the hand motion while delivering assist-as-needed haptic therapy (for the voluntary component) and avoiding unsafe amplification of hand tremors. Experimental evaluations are provided to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed AHR system.},

Therefore, in this paper, we show how to design an intuitive training system to acquire this specific skill using different cues in Virtual Reality (VR). Using VR, we can easily provide visual information, attach haptic devices, and distort the speed of time, however, it is difficult to decide which types of information could benefit the training. In an initial study, by comparing real world training with VR training, we showed the effect of VR training and obtained some insights about augmentation for training spin shots. The training system was then improved by adding three new conditions using different visualizations and temporal distortions, as well as a haptic racket for creating realistic feedback. Finally, we performed a detailed experiment, which suggest a significant improvement of skill for each condition compared to the baseline, while a qualitative evaluation indicates that both users' motivation and their understanding of spin are increased by using our system.},

One such improvement is the implementation and amalgamation of haptic feedback technology into RS which will permit the operating surgeon on the console to receive haptic information on the type of tissue being operated on. The main advantage of using this is to allow the operating surgeon to feel and control the amount of force applied to different tissues during surgery thus minimising the risk of tissue damage due to both the direct and indirect effects of excessive tissue force or tension being applied during RS.

This review provides a summary of technological enhancements in RS, considering different stages of work, from proof of concept to cadaver tissue testing, surgery in animals, and finally real implementation in surgical practice. We identify that at the time of this review, while there is a unanimous agreement regarding need for haptic and tactile feedback, there are no solutions or products available that address this need.

	abstract = {Teleoperation systems have been developed in order to allow a human operator to perform complex tasks in remote environments. Mobile robots can be considered as a particular example of telemanipulation systems, since they can be operated remotely to perform particular tasks. As an example, the inspection of underwater structures and the removal of mines are performed by mobile platforms controlled by a remote operator, which generally takes advantage only of the visual feedback provided by vision systems. In this sense, the nature and completeness of the data provided to the operator about the state of the remote system are of crucial importance for proper task execution, and it is generally accepted that a more efficient achievement of the task can be obtained by increasing the amount of data feedback and using proper MMI. In this paper, the use of a haptic interface is proposed in order to increase a user's perception of the workspace of a mobile robot. In particular, a virtual interaction force is computed on the basis of obstacles surrounding the mobile vehicle in order to prevent dangerous contacts, so that navigation tasks can be carried out with generally better performances. In addition, passivity of the overall system is taken into account, so that stability of the virtual interaction is guaranteed.},

Robot teleoperation is very useful when user and robot cannot share the same workspace due to hazardous environments, inaccessible locations, or because of ergonomic issues. In this sense, this article introduces a novel dual-arm teleoperation architecture with haptic and visual feedback to enhance the operator immersion in surface treatment tasks. Two task-based assistance systems are also proposed to control each robotic manipulator individually. To validate the remote assisted control, some usability tests have been carried out using Baxter, a dual-arm collaborative robot.

Among the different application fields, robotic teleoperation represents the ideal scenario that can largely benefit from wearability to reduce constraints to the human workspace (acting as a master) and enable an intuitive and simplified information exchange within the teleoperator system. This effective simplification is particularly important if we consider the interaction with synergy-inspired robotic devices, i.e., those that are endowed with a reduced number of control inputs and sensors, with the goal of simplifying control and communication among humans and robots. In this article, we present an integrated approach for augmented teleoperation where wearable hand/arm pose undersensing and haptic feedback devices are combined with teleimpedance (TI) techniques for the simplified yet effective position and stiffness control of a synergy-inspired robotic manipulator in real time. The slave robot consists of a KUKA lightweight robotic arm equipped with the Pisa/IIT SoftHand, both controlled in impedance to perform a drilling task-an illustrative example of a dynamic task with environmental constraints. The experimental results from ten healthy subjects suggest that the proposed integrated interface enables the master to appropriately regulate the stiffness and pose of the robotic hand-arm system through the perception of interaction forces and vision, contributing to successful and intuitive executions of the remote task. The achieved performance is presented in comparison to the reduced versions of the integrated system, in which either TI control or wearable feedback is excluded.},

	abstract = {Surface electrical stimulation (SES) is being investigated as a noninvasive method to evoke natural sensations distal to electrode location. This may improve treatment for phantom limb pain as well as provide an alternative method to deliver sensory feedback. The median and/or ulnar nerves of 35 subjects were stimulated at the elbow using surface electrodes. Strength-duration curves of hand sensation were found for each subject. All subjects experienced sensation in their hand, which was mostly described as a paresthesia-like sensation. The rheobase and chronaxie values were found to be lower for the median nerve than the ulnar nerve, with no significant difference between sexes. Repeated sessions with the same subject resulted in sufficient variability to suggest that recalculating the strength-duration curve for each electrode placement is necessary. Most of the recruitment curves in this study were generated with 28 to 36 data points. To quickly reproduce these curves with limited increase in error, we recommend 10 data points. Future studies will focus on obtaining different sensations using SES with the strength-duration curve defining the threshold of the effective parameter space. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},
